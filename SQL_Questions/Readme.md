# Basic Sql Questions

## 1 What is SQL?

 Structured Query Language SQL is a database tool that is used to create and access the database to support software applications.
 
MySQL is a multithreaded, multi-user SQL database management system which has more than 11 million installations. It is the world's second most popular and widely-used open source database. It is interesting how MySQL name was given to this query language. The term My is coined by the name of the daughter of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and SQL is the short form of Structured Query Language. Using MySQL is free of cost for the developer, but enterprises have to pay a license fee to Oracle.

Formerly MySQL was initially owned by a for-profit firm MySQL AB, then Sun Microsystems bought it, and then Oracle bought Sun Microsystems, so Oracle currently owns MySQL.

MySQL is an Oracle-supported Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) based on structured query language. MySQL supports a wide range of operating systems, most famous of those include Windows, Linux & UNIX. Although it is possible to develop a wide range of applications with MySQL, it is only used for web applications & online publishing. It is a fundamental part of an open-source enterprise known as Lamp.



## 2) What are tables in SQL?

The table is a collection of records and information in a single view.


## 3. What does a MySQL database contain?
A MySQL database contains one or more tables, each of which contains records or rows. Within these rows are various columns or fields that contain the data itself.

## 4. How can you interact with MySQL?
There are three main ways you can interact with MySQL: 

using a command line
via a web interface
through a programming language
#3 5. What are MySQL Database Queries?
A query is a specific request or a question. One can query a database for specific information and have a record returned.

## 5.What are MySQL “Views”?
In MySQL, a view consists of a set of rows that is returned if a particular query is executed. This is also known as a ‘virtual table’. Views make it easy to retrieve the way of making the query available via an alias. 
The advantages of views are:

- Simplicity
- Security
- Maintainability

## 6.What are MySQL Triggers?
A trigger is a task that executes in response to some predefined database event, such as after a new row is added to a particular table. Specifically, this event involves inserting, modifying, or deleting table data, and the task can occur either prior to or immediately following any such event. 
Triggers have many purposes, including:

- Audit Trails
- Validation
- Referential integrity enforcement
 ## 7. How many Triggers are possible in MySQL?
 There are six Triggers allowed to use in the MySQL database:

- Before Insert
- After Insert
- Before Update
- After Update
- Before Delete
- After Delete

## 8.What is DBMS?
DBMS stands for Database Management System. DBMS is a system software responsible for the creation, retrieval, updation, and management of the database. It ensures that our data is consistent, organized, and is easily accessible by serving as an interface between the database and its end-users or application software

## 9. What is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The key difference here, compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables, and relations can be defined between the common fields of these tables. Most modern database management systems like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Amazon Redshift are based on RDBMS.
