/*
WINDOW FUNCTION

- Window function applies aggregate, ranking and analytic functions  over a particular window; for example, sum, avg, or row_number
And OVER clause is used with window functions to define that  window.

*/



/*


Letâ€™s look at some definitions:


- Expression is the name of the column that we want the window  function operated on. This may not be necessary depending on what  window function is used

- OVER is just to signify that this is a window function

- PARTITION BY divides the rows into partitions so we can specify which  rows to use to compute the window function

- ORDER BY is used so that we can order the rows within each partition.  This is optional and does not have to be specified

- ROWS can be used if we want to further limit the rows within our  partition. This is optional and usually not used



*/

/*
Window Function Types

- Aggregate Functioons :- sum(),count(),min(),max(),avg()
- Ranking FUnctions :- ROW_NUMBER(),RANK(),DENSE_RANK(),PERCENT_RANK(),NTILE()
- Analytic Functions :- LEAD(),LAG(),FIRST_VALUE,LAST_VALUE,NTH_VALUE

FROM test_wf;



How NTH_VALUE Works Without Specified Frame
For the first row (new_id = 100):

-The window frame is: [100]

There's no 2nd value here, so NTH_VALUE(new_id, 2) returns NULL.

- For the second row (new_id = 200):

- The window frame is: [100, 200]

The 2nd value is 200, so NTH_VALUE(new_id, 2) returns 200.

- For the third row (new_id = 500):

The window frame is: [100, 200, 500]

The 2nd value is 200, so NTH_VALUE(new_id, 2) returns 200.

Why It Gave NULL
In the first row's frame, there aren't enough rows to find a second value.

Since NTH_VALUE(new_id, 2) needs the second value and it doesn't exist in the frame for the first row, it returns NULL.
