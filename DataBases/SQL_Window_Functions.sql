/*
WINDOW FUNCTION

- Window function applies aggregate, ranking and analytic functions  over a particular window; for example, sum, avg, or row_number
And OVER clause is used with window functions to define that  window.

*/



/*


Letâ€™s look at some definitions:


- Expression is the name of the column that we want the window  function operated on. This may not be necessary depending on what  window function is used

- OVER is just to signify that this is a window function

- PARTITION BY divides the rows into partitions so we can specify which  rows to use to compute the window function

- ORDER BY is used so that we can order the rows within each partition.  This is optional and does not have to be specified

- ROWS/RANGE can be used if we want to further limit the rows within our  partition. This is optional and usually not used



*/

/*
Window Function Types (Not official division )

- Aggregate Functioons :- sum(),count(),min(),max(),avg()
- Ranking FUnctions :- ROW_NUMBER(),RANK(),DENSE_RANK(),PERCENT_RANK(),NTILE()

-- Ranking Functions
/*
ROW_NUMBER() :-The ROW_NUMBER function assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within the partition of a result set, starting at 1 for the first row.

RANK(): - The RANK() function assigns a rank to each row within the partition of a result set. When it encounters ties (duplicate values), it assigns the same rank to the tied values and skips the consecutive ranks for the next values.

DENSE_RANK():- The DENSE_RANK function assigns a rank to each row within the partition of a result set, and if there are duplicate values, it assigns the same rank to those values. Unlike RANK(), DENSE_RANK continues the ranking without skipping any ranks after the duplicates.

PERCENT_RANK():- The PERCENT_RANK function assigns a rank in percentages to each row within the partition of a result set, and if there are duplicate values, it assigns the same rank to those values. Unlike RANK(), PERCENT_RANK continues the ranking without skipping any ranks after the duplicates.

NTILE():- The NTILE function assigns a bucket number to each row in the partition, with the number of buckets specified as an argument.

NTILE(4) number can be any thing and  it will divides the rows into number of buckets (quartiles) with in column we specified.

How NTH_VALUE Works Without Specified Frame

For the first row (new_id = 100):

-The window frame is: [100]

There's no 2nd value here, so NTH_VALUE(new_id, 2) returns NULL.

- For the second row (new_id = 200):

- The window frame is: [100, 200]

The 2nd value is 200, so NTH_VALUE(new_id, 2) returns 200.

- For the third row (new_id = 500):

The window frame is: [100, 200, 500]

The 2nd value is 200, so NTH_VALUE(new_id, 2) returns 200.

Why It Gave NULL
In the first row's frame, there aren't enough rows to find a second value.

Since NTH_VALUE(new_id, 2) needs the second value and it doesn't exist in the frame for the first row, it returns NULL.

/*

-- Window (or Partition) : Defines a group of rows for the window function to operate on.
 
 A window function creates a window, also known as a partition. This window is a subset of rows defined by the PARTITION BY clause.
 All rows sharing the same value(s) in the partitioning column(s) form a partition.

-- Frame :- Defines a subset of the partition for more specific operations.

 Within each partition, a frame is a further subset of rows defined by the ROWS or RANGE clause. 
 This frame determines the specific rows the window function operates on within the partition.



In SQL window functions is used to define the set of rows that the window function operates over, called the window frame. The frame can be defined using ROWS or RANGE, each with its own behavior:

-- ROWS vs. RANGE

ROWS: Defines the window frame in terms of a specific number of rows before and after the current row.

RANGE: Defines the window frame in terms of a range of values relative to the current row's value.

DEFAULT FRAME Implementation in SQl  is 

------- RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW -------

-- Frame Specifications

- UNBOUNDED PRECEDING: The frame starts at the first row of the partition.

- UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING: The frame ends at the last row of the partition.

- CURRENT ROW: The frame includes only the current row.

- n PRECEDING: The frame starts n rows before the current row.

- n FOLLOWING: The frame ends n rows after the current row.


*/




/*

FIRST_VALUE
Behavior: The FIRST_VALUE function retrieves the first value in the specified frame.

Default Frame: RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

Impact: For most use cases, FIRST_VALUE consistently returns the first value in the ordered set within the partition. 
The default frame specification usually doesn't alter its expected behavior, as the first row remains consistent.

By default, the FIRST_VALUE might not cover all rows unless the frame is explicitly set to include all rows (UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING).

/*
LAST_VALUE

The LAST_VALUE function retrieves the last value in the specified frame.
Behavior: The LAST_VALUE function retrieves the last value in the specified frame.

Default Frame: RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

Impact: The default frame often limits the result to the current row or a subset of rows, thus potentially not reflecting the true last value of the entire partition.
- Adjusting the frame to UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING ensures it considers all rows.
- Better to use RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

Definition: The LEAD function provides access to a row at a specified physical offset following the current row.

Frame Impact: While LEAD  do not directly use frame clauses, their interaction with other window functions can be influenced by the frame.
